Sales comparison by region

### The Problem Statement:

The director of the superstore wants to compare the sales between two regions. He has asked each region operators to record the sales data to compare by region. The managerial board was thinking of replacing some products from their stores with new categories focusing on cosmetic products. The stores are located across various regions of United States. Find your insights on what you think should be done.

### Steps undertaken to solve the business problem:
◾ The analysis is done based on sales in four key regions of US : East, West, Central and South.
◾ Using Tableau, an interactive dashboard was created to directly compare the sales between each of these regions. The dashboard also provides the sales analysis based on each of the subcategories of products which are sold in these stores across various regions.

### Key Insights:
◾ The South region needs a serious inspection, the sales, number of customers as well as number of orders are very low compared to other regions. Probably, increasing the number of products in the stores in the South region can help.
◾ In each of the regions, the stationary items like Art, Envelopes, Fasteners and Labels had the least sales. So if the decision to replace items with cosmetics products, then these items would be ideal to replace in terms of sales. But the necessity of the product is to be evaluated.
